# JARVIS – A Personal Voice Assistant (Learning Project)

This is a small personal voice assistant I’m building in Python while learning how voice recognition, text-to-speech, and basic system automation work together.

It’s inspired by the idea of JARVIS, but this project is not meant to be a full assistant. It’s mainly a learning and experimentation project and is still in progress.


### Project Status

- Learning project
- Actively being worked on
- Features are added gradually as I learn
- Expect bugs, rough edges, and changes


### What it can do (so far)

- Listens for a wake word (“Jarvis”)
- Responds using text-to-speech
- Opens and closes apps like Chrome, Spotify, and VS Code
- Controls media (play, pause, next, volume, mute)
- Searches Google and YouTube using voice commands
- Tells the current time and date
- Can shut down the system
- Shows a small on-screen status indicator (wake, listening, processing, done)
- Plays a sound when activated


### Built With

- Python 3
- speech_recognition
- gTTS
- pygame
- pyautogui
- tkinter


### A Few Notes

- Learn Python in a practical way
- Understand how voice assistants work behind the scenes
- Experiment with system control and simple UI feedback


### What’s next

- Cleaner visuals and animations
- More reliable command handling
- Better structure and cleanup
- Exploring optional offline features later


### Disclaimer

This project is not production-ready and not meant for serious use.
It’s a personal learning project, and things may break as I experiment.



_Let's hope for the best!_
